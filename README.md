# UFO Sightings: The Truth is Out There
Data: data.js Tools used: javacript and HTML

# Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to create a user-friendly dashboard for people to visit the website and use the table to research different UFO sightings in different areas using the various filters. 

# Results
The webpage is now updated to include filters for:
* date
* city
* state
* country 
* shape

Users can easily enter the information they are looking for in the filters on the right then simply press enter to view the results on the left in the table.

# Summary 

## Drawbacks
* The dataset is very limited at the current momment and therefore the website search capabilities are limited.
* The data is static, meaning that the user isn't always seeing the most up to date information

## Reccomendations
* Expand the dataset beyond 2010 to include more sightings. Having a larger database will make the website more credible to the user.  
* Perhaps link the website to an API with a button to click update to have the most curren sighting included.
